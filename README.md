# Hey, I'm Emre Yasar!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently studying **Medical Informatics at FHNW** and working as an **ICT supporter at the University of Basel**. In my free time, I refurbish and sell used computers – not just for sustainability, but to give good tech a second life and make it accessible again.

## What I do

- **Bachelor Thesis**: Developing an **Orthanc plugin** that scans DICOM files for keywords and email addresses, generates ZIP downloads with optional password protection, and handles secure archiving.
- **Fullstack Projects**: Building medical imaging web apps using **React**, **Spring Boot**, **Keycloak**, **Docker**, and **NGINX** – from backend to frontend with secure access.
- **Authentication & Security**: Deep integration of Keycloak (even without client secrets), OAuth2-proxy setups, and secure Blob-based image loading.
- **Monitoring & DevOps**: Integrated **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **cAdvisor**, and GitLab CI/CD to monitor systems, containers, and application health without server-side modifications.
- **Bioinformatics & Image Analysis**: Experienced in working with DNA/plasmid sequences, pattern recognition, and annotation tools for biological data.

## Tools & Technologies I work with

> I prefer clean, minimalistic setups – as long as they’re solid and reliable.

- **Languages**: Java, Python, JavaScript, Bash, C++
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, React
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitLab CI/CD, NGINX, Linux
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Other Tools**: Orthanc, DICOM, Keycloak, Prometheus, Grafana
