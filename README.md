Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I recently **completed my Bachelor’s Thesis** in Medical Informatics at FHNW and am currently awaiting the evaluation of my results. In parallel, I continue to work as an **ICT Supporter at the University of Basel**. Outside work, I refurbish and sell used computers—combining sustainability with giving tech a second life.

## Education & Thesis

- **Authentication & Security**: Deep Keycloak integration, OAuth2-proxy setups, secure Blob-based image delivery  
- **Monitoring & DevOps**: Prometheus, Grafana, cAdvisor, GitLab CI/CD—no server-side code changes required  
- **Bioinformatics & Image Analysis**: DNA/plasmid sequence work, pattern recognition, annotation tooling  

## Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Java, Python, JavaScript, Bash, C++  
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, React
